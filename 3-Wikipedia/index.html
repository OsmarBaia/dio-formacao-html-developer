                Final Fantasy Tactics is a tactical role-playing game in which
                players follow the story of protagonist Ramza Beoulve.[1] The
                game features two modes of play: battles and the world map.[2]
                Battles take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields.[1]
                Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles;
                movement and action ranges are determined by the character's
                statistics and job class.[3] The battlefield also factors in
                elements such as terrain and weather to determine strategic
                advantages and disadvantages during clashes.[4] Battles are
                turn-based; a unit may act when its Charge Time (CT) reaches 100
                and increased once every CT unit (a measure of time in battles)
                by an amount equal to the unit's speed statistic.[5] During
                battle, whenever a unit performs an action successfully, it
                gains experience points (EXP) and job points (JP).[1] Actions
                can include magical attacks, physical attacks, or using an
                item.[5][6] Hit points (HP) of enemy units are also visible to
                the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the
                player to know how much damage they still have to inflict on a
                particular unit.[7]

                <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                  The story takes place in the kingdom of Ivalice, inspired by
                  the Middle Ages.[6][12] The kingdom is located in a peninsula
                  surrounded by sea on the north, west and south, with a
                  headland south of the landmass. It is heavily populated by
                  human beings, although intelligent monsters can be found
                  living in less populated areas. Magic is predominant in the
                  land, although ruins and artifacts indicated that the past
                  populace had relied on machinery, such as airships and robots.
                  Ivalice's neighbors are the kingdom of Ordalia in the east and
                  Romanda, a military nation to the north. While the three
                  nations share common royal bloodlines, major wars have taken
                  place between them. An influential religious institution known
                  as the Glabados Church heads the dominant faith, centering
                  around a religious figure known as Saint Ajora.

                <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                  Ivalice is recovering from the Fifty Year War against Ordalia.
                  After the death of its ruler, Princess Ovelia and Prince
                  Orinas are both candidates for the throne. The former is
                  supported by Prince Goltana of the Black Lion, and the latter
                  by Queen Ruvelia and her brother, Prince Larg of the White
                  Lion. The two groups engage in battles in the Lion War.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                  Nobles and commoners regard each other negatively and many
                  commoners joined the Corpse Brigade to fight against the
                  nobles' soldiers. Ramza, part of the noble Beoulve family of
                  knights, and Delita, his childhood friend who was an ordinary
                  commoner, witness the murder of Delita's sister during an
                  uprising. This causes Delita and Ramza to abandon their ties
                  to the nobility. Ramza joins a mercenary group, led by
                  Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia from being hunted by
                  both sides of the Lion War. Delita joins Goltana's forces.
                  They are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to
                  Prince Larg. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Delacroix of
                  the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia. Along the way, Ramza
                  meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic
                  called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the
                  power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Delacroix's
                  intervention.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                  Ramza discovers that High Confessor Marcel Funebris and the
                  church used the legend of the holy Zodiac Braves to gather the
                  Zodiac Stones and instigated the Lion War. To prevent Ramza's
                  interference, Delacroix uses the stone to transform into a
                  Lucavi demon and Ramza defeats him. Ramza is regarded as a
                  heretic by the church and he is chased by the Knights Templar,
                  the soldiers of the church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones.
                  He acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a
                  central figure in the religion, and attempts to use it along
                  with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.
